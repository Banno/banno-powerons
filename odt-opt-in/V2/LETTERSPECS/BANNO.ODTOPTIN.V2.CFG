*
* This letterfile contains parameters for the BANNO.ODTOPTIN.V2.POW specfile. Each line starting with an asterisk 
* will be considered a comment so feel free to add additional lines as necessary.  Each line in this letterfile cannot
* be longer than 126 characters. Each parameter setting consists of a parameter name followed by a colon and the 
* parameter value (for example: 'CT: 1'). Where instructions call for entering a range of values, enter single or group
* values separated by commas - ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*
* Where the 'VALID VALUES' comment references a 'range of values', you may enter individual values separated by commas,
* a range of values separated by a dash or a combination of the two. For example, entering '1,3-5,7' would be the same
* as entering '1,3,4,5,7'. For a range of values, leading 0s can be dropped for brevity.
