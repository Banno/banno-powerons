* in this letterfile cannot be longer than 126 characters. Each
* parameter setting consists of a parameter name followed by a colon and
* the parameter value. For example: 'ST: 1'.
* Each parameter will have a default value which will be used by the

* Where the 'VALID VALUES' comment references a 'range of values', you
* may enter individual values separated by commas, a range of values
* separated by a dash or a combination of the two. For example,
* entering '1,3-5,7' would be the same as entering '1,3,4,5,7'. For a
* range of values, leading 0s can be dropped for brevity.
