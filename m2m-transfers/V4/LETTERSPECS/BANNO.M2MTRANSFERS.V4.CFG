* This letterfile contains parameters for the BNOCUST.xxx.TEMPLATE.POW specfile. Each line starting with an asterisk 
* will be considered a comment so feel free to add additional lines as necessary.  Each line in this letterfile cannot
* be longer than 126 characters. Each parameter setting consists of a parameter name followed by a colon and the 
* parameter value (for example: 'CT: 1'). Where instructions call for entering a range of values, enter single or group
* values separated by commas - ex. 1,10-20,30,33.

* PROGRAM PARAMETER SETTINGS START HERE ********************************************************************************
*
*
* PROGRAM INSTALLATION DATE
*  Line must begin with "PID:"
*
*  Enter the date the program was activated in the production system. Additional program data will be 
*  accessible for 60 days after the installation date to assist with issues tracking.
*  VALID VALUES: Any valid date on or prior to the system date in the following format: mm/dd/yyyy.
*  DEFAULT: In absence of a date, 60 days from the program's most recent modification date will be used.
PID:
*
*
* ERROR DISPLAY MESSAGES
*  Line must be formatted as "EDMxxx:" where xxx represents the 3-digit error code that is returned to the UX.
*  Optionally, set Spanish versions of the message using "EDMxxx_SP:" format.
*  Up to 5 text lines can be defined per error code.
*  VALID VALUES: "EDMxxx" where xxx is included in the list of supported error codes.
*
*  Supported Error Codes:
*   500 - System is in memo mode (CREATETRAN)
* 
*  Example: 
*   EDM501: This account does not have enough funds to make a withdrawal.
*   EDM501: You have an available balance of $0.00
*  
EDM500:System is in Memo Mode
EDM500_SP:El sistema est&aacute; en modo memo
*
*
* SPANISH LANGUAGE SUPPORT
*  Set the Spanish Language Support (SLS) parameter to TRUE if Spanish versions of
*  soft text and error messages should be returned to the UX for Spanish speakers. 
*  Valid values are: TRUE or FALSE.  Default is FALSE if the parameter does not exist
*  or if it contains a blank value.
*
SLS:FALSE
*
*
* ALLOW MEMO MODE TRANSFERS
*  Line must begin with "MMXF:"
*  Should the program allow real-time transfers when the system is in memo mode.
*  VALID VALUES: TRUE or FALSE
*  DEFAULT: TRUE
MMXF: TRUE
*
*
* INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT TYPES
*  Line must begin with "IAT:"
*  Enter invalid account types on one line using commas or a range of values. If no account types are 
*  entered, all account types will be assumed valid.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 0-9999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAT: NONE
*
*
*  INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT WARNING CODE(S) TO EXCLUDE
*  Line must begin with "AW:"
*  Enter account level warning codes to exclude access to the program.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 1-999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAW: NONE
*
*
* ENFORCE LIMITS
*  Line must begin with "EL:"
*  Should the program enforce daily transfer limits as defined below and or in the member's Preference record.
*  VALID VALUES: TRUE or FALSE
*  DEFAULT: FALSE
EL: FALSE
*
*
* TOTAL COUNT LIMIT & TOTAL AMOUNT LIMIT & INDIVIDUAL LIMIT
*  If ENFORCE LIMITS is set to TRUE (turned on) the GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT (GCL)
*  and the GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT (GAL) and the GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT (GIL)
*  will determine the global limits in place unless overridden by the member's own Preference Record Settings.
*  The GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT represents the number of transfers which can be set up by the user on a daily basis.
*  The GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT represents the aggregate total amount of transfers set up on a daily basis. The
*  GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT represents the limit for each individual transfer.
*
*
*  This table determins which limit value will be used when both the global limit and the Preference 
*  record limits are set. "9999" represents an unlimited count value and $999,999.99 represents an
*  unlimited amount value. For brevity, the table uses the count values. Amount values would follow 
*  the same logic.
*
*   Global        Preference     Value
*   Setting       Record         Used

* If set, this value overrides any other logic used to determine the status of debug mode.
*
DEBUGMODE:
*
*  Test mode uses the results below instead of the calculations produced by the CUs program.
*   TESTEC forces an error condition:

*  the most current version of the program.
*  VALID VALUES: TRUE or FALSE
*  DEFAULT: FALSE
TESTMODE:FALSE
*
* TESTACCOUNTLIST
*  If TESTMODE=TRUE then the accounts listed here will be able to test
*  the most recent changes to the PowerOn program while all other
*  members will be running the prior version. You can list up to 10
