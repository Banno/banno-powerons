*  Ver. 3.0.0  10/10/22 T. Kainz - Created for BANNO.M2MTRANSFERS.V3.POW
*  Ver. 3.1.0  04/19/23 R. Robison - Added new params for label soft text
*  Ver. 3.2.2  07/10/24 J. Keenan - Added Program Installation Date
*                          parameter
*
* PROGRAM PARAMETER SETTINGS START HERE ********************************
* PROGRAM INSTALLATION DATE
*  Line must begin with "PID:"
*
*  Enter the date the program was activated in the production system.
*  Additional program data will be accessible for 90 days after the
*  installation date to assist with issues tracking.
*  VALID VALUES: Any valid date on or prior to the system date. in the
*                following format: mm/dd/yyyy.
*  DEFAULT: In absence of a date, 90 days from the program's most recent
*           modification date will be used.
PID:
* INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT TYPES
*  Line must begin with "IAT:"
*  Enter invalid account types on one line using commas or a range of
*  values. If no account types are entered, all account types will be
*  assumed valid.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 0-9999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAT: NONE
*
*  INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT WARNING CODE(S) TO EXCLUDE
*  Line must begin with "AW:"
*  Enter account level warning codes to exclude access to the program.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 1-999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAW: NONE
*
* ENFORCE LIMITS
*  Line must begin with "EL:"
*  Should the program enforce daily transfer limits as defined below
*  and or in the member's Preference record.
*  VALID VALUES: TRUE or FALSE
*  DEFAULT: FALSE
EL: FALSE
*
* TOTAL COUNT LIMIT & TOTAL AMOUNT LIMIT & INDIVIDUAL LIMIT
*  If ENFORCE LIMITS is set to TRUE (turned on) the GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT (GCL)
*  and the GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT (GAL) and the GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT (GIL)
*  will determine the global limits in place
*  unless overridden by the member's own Preference Record Settings.
*  The GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT represents the number of transfers which can be
*  set up by the user on a daily basis. The GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT represents
*  the aggregate total amount of transfers set up on a daily basis. The
*  GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT represents the limit for each individual
*  transfer.
*
*  This table determins which limit value will be used when both the
*  global limit and the Preference record limits are set. "9999"
*  represents an unlimited count value and $999,999.99 represents an
*  unlimited amount value. For brevity, the table uses the count
*  values. Amount values would follow the same logic.
*
*   Global        Preference     Value
*   Setting       Record         Used
