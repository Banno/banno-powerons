* This letterfile contains parameters for the
* BANNO.M2MTRANSFERS.V1.POW specfile. Each line starting with an
* asterisk will be considered a comment so feel free to add additional
* lines as necessary.  Each  line in this letterfile cannot be longer
* than 126 characters. Each parameter setting consists of a parameter
* name followed by a colon and the parameter value
*  (for example: 'ST: 1')
*
*  Ver. 1.0.1  12/03/21 T. Kainz - Added 'TC' Parameter Setting
*
* PROGRAM PARAMETER SETTINGS START HERE ********************************
* INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT TYPES
*  Line must begin with "IAT:"
*  Enter invalid account types on one line using commas or a range of
*  values. If no account types are entered, all account types will be
*  assumed valid.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 0-9999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAT: NONE
*
*  INELIGIBLE ACCOUNT WARNING CODE(S) TO EXCLUDE
*  Line must begin with "AW:"
*  Enter account level warning codes to exclude access to the program.
*  Enter as comma delimited single or range values. ex. 1,10-20,30,33.
*  VALID VALUES: 1-999 or NONE
*  DEFAULT: NONE
IAW: NONE
*
* ENFORCE LIMITS
*  Line must begin with "EL:"
*  Should the program enforce daily transfer limits as defined below
*  and or in the member's Preference record.
*  VALID VALUES: TRUE or FALSE
*  DEFAULT: FALSE
EL: FALSE
*
* TOTAL COUNT LIMIT & TOTAL AMOUNT LIMIT & INDIVIDUAL LIMIT
*  If ENFORCE LIMITS is set to TRUE (turned on) the GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT (GCL)
*  and the GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT (GAL) and the GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT (GIL)
*  will determine the global limits in place
*  unless overridden by the member's own Preference Record Settings.
*  The GLOBAL COUNT LIMIT represents the number of transfers which can be
*  set up by the user on a daily basis. The GLOBAL AMOUNT LIMIT represents
*  the aggregate total amount of transfers set up on a daily basis. The
*  GLOBAL INDIVIDUAL LIMIT represents the limit for each individual
*  transfer.
*
*  This table determins which limit value will be used when both the
*  global limit and the Preference record limits are set. "9999"
*  represents an unlimited count value and $999,999.99 represents an
*  unlimited amount value. For brevity, the table uses the count
*  values. Amount values would follow the same logic.
